                                            demeanor was often severe, and on nights like tonight, it harbored closer to
                                            irritation. In these moods, his wife knew better than to ask questions.
                                            "I’ll be catching up on some work, and will join the two of you for
                                            dinner"he continued, heading straight to the dimly lit office. The wife
                                            wiped her hands on her apron, out of habit, and glanced over at Calvin,
                                            their child of only 6 years, playing with his iPad. He was deeply enthralled
                                            by the screen in front of him, barely noticing his father having arrived
                                            home. The wife headed to the kitchen to sort out dinner.<br/> <br/>

                                            Apart from his obsession with screens, Calvin was otherwise a good child. He
                                            was sensitive and kindhearted, and had no trouble getting along with other
                                            kids. <br /> <br /> Even at the tender age of 5, his parents were extremely
                                            fond of him. (although sometimes he was fussy: asking mom for toy while
                                            she’s talking to someone at supermarket; asking dad when he could stop doing
                                            the homework assigned, over and over and over again). Despite the fussiness,
                                            he had amazing characterisitics. Yesterday at recess, when he was picked as
                                            team captain, he chose first the one child no one wanted on their team to
                                            prevent her from feeling left out. The day before that, he migrated a poor
                                            worm to a group of worms out of fear that it would be lonely (is helping
                                            worms strange) , but his imagination always left him with the best
                                            intentions.<br/> <br/>
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            A stew brewing on the stove top in no time, she thought.<br/> <br/>

                                            "Momma!" Calvin screamed, right as the wife reached for the sharp kitchen
                                            knife. She drew in a breath of exasperation as she walked over to the child.

                                            "What is it? You know your father needs his quiet." The wife looked at
                                            Calvin’s round pouty face as he handed her the iPad.<br/> <br/>

                                            "It died." His face reddened as his eyes filled with water. He looked almost
                                            like a tomato ripening too quickly.<br/> <br/>

                                            "I did tell you to charge it earlier and you did not listen. Now you must
                                            pay the price." Calvin began crying in annoyance. "if you don’t quit it, I
                                            will give you something to cry about." He wiped the falling tears from his
                                            large brown eyes, clearly struggling to not cry. The wife took pity, and
                                            said in a cheerful but low voice, "Tell you what: while we charge the iPad,
                                            you can sit on the kitchen counter and help me prepare dinner."<br/> <br/>

                                            Calvin didn’t enjoy spending time in the kitchen, but sitting on the counter
                                            opened doors to possibilities. In the brief second that he nodded and wiped
                                            the tears off his face, he imagined ruling over either side of the island
                                            counter; the entire living room his domain to rule. The wife swiftly plugged
                                            in the iPad, setting it on the side table, grabbed the five year old and sat
                                            him on the wide ceramic counter.<br/> <br/>

                                            The wife opened the Frigidaire, carefully removing the vegetables she had
                                            bought at the flea market earlier that day. She gave them a thorough wash as
                                            Calvin beamed over his new view. Calvin’s voice settled into a low hubbub in
                                            the wife’s ears as she washed and hummed a familiar tune. Afterwards, the
                                            vegetables emitted a dewey glow she found quite peculiar. The kitchen light
                                            up above gave She chucked it up to the warm kitchen lights and moved on to
                                            check on the boiling water. <br /> <br />

                                        <p>To the wife’s naked eye, this kitchen was an ordinary one; plaid curtains on
                                            the large window between wooden counters, a simple overhead light, and old
                                            wooden floors. But something was off, and young Calvin would soon fall
                                            victim to this reality. Calvin could no longer marvel at the kingdom
                                            stretched ahead of him, for he had locked eyes with that seemed like a face
                                            — better yet, a child’s face. <br/> <br/>The wife continued her hum, turning around to
                                            wink and smile at Calvin and to glance at the counter. The carrots laid
                                            limp, lanky with thick shrubs of green for hair. The tomatoes, and,
                                            cauliflower, and kale beside it — already washed — looked almost ready to
                                            eat. But Calvin experienced it differently.

                                            "M…mom?" the tiny voice whispered in panic. Calvin had not spoken. What he
                                            saw before him was a bright young tomato, attached to older looking ones the
                                            stems, turning to either side for an explanation.<br/> <br/>

                                            "I don’t know, sweetie, I dont know. Perhaps—"<br/> <br/>

                                            "Oh no… they were right…we’re gonna die!" another voice spoke.<br/> <br/>

                                            Calvin could not believe his eyes. Next to him sitting on the counter were
                                            not ordinary tomatoes. They had eyes, a face…..a voice. Calvin rose his two
                                            hands to his eyes, giving them a good rub the same way he does when he wakes
                                            up in the morning. He must have been dreaming. But he wasn’t.</p>

                                            "Daddy, what’s going on?" They were a tomato bunch — 4 of them to be
                                            precise.

                                            One I identified as the mother, a child, and a man whose voice reminded
                                            Calvin of his PopPop. The fourth had dead eyes, which could only mean one
                                            thing. The 4th tomato bled out its juice from one side, where there appears
                                            to be a dark bruise. <br/> <br/>

                                            "Daddy, please tell me." The youngest tomato turned its round face to see
                                            the fourth tomato. Calvin heard a cry of grief he had never experienced
                                            before. It was none but the youngest tomato, the one most like him,
                                            screaming in grief at what it was seeing. Calvin could feel his hearts
                                            beating, but could no longer feel his stomach.<br/> <br/>

                                            "Mama!" Calvin cried, his voice shaking with upset. He lifted both his
                                            chubby arms to be picked up from the counter like he used to as an infant,
                                            but his mother would not have any of it.

                                            "Now Calvin, stop making such a fuss. Your father needs his quiet. And I

                                        even imagine jumping off the counter. He looked in his lap, where it felt safe.
                                        His little fists rested them, and Calvin gave his entire focus to them. The warm
                                        light above revealed the sweat on them. As long as he ignores them, maybe
                                        they’ll go away, he thought. But his eyes got the best of him; and by then it
                                        was too late. On what seems to be half the island counter, various vegetables
                                        screamed in horror and fear. 
                                        <br/> <br/>The cauliflower had half its head missing, stuck in
                                        a cycle of fainting and waking up. The carrots laid on top of each other,
                                        drenched in what seemed like sweat, making an effort to break the band together.
                                        Calvin was paralyzed. The wife turned to his direction, ignoring him completely,
                                        and grabbing the tomatoes to be placed on the chopping block on the parallel
                                        counter.

                                        "NO, PLEASE PLEASE JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT AND I’LL— " the sentence ended
                                        once the chopping knight hit the board, following by a cacophony of screams.
                                        Calvin shuddered, and what felt like sweat suddenly turned cold on his back. He
                                        heard the younger tomato meet his fate, and watched pieces of their corpses get
                                        tossed into the stew. <br/> <br/>
                                    </p>

                                    <p> And so it went on. For each of them. Calvin continued sobbing as the wife
                                        hummed, completely unaware of the atrocities she was causing. The kale, whose
                                        distinguishable deep voice rung in Calvin’s ears as the last one, waited its
                                        turn having gotten over his fate. Calvin’s sobs caused his entire body to
                                        convulse.

                                        The wife, finally giving in, grabs Calvin from under each arm and sets him on
                                        the floor.
                                        "Alright, alright. I think the GameBoy is done charging." She pats his head.

                                        "Now be a good boy, and play quietly while your father works". Calvin couldn’t
                                        believe everything that had happened. He couldn’t draw for a full breath of air.
                                        With little legs giving out, he want behind the lazy suzan, towards the dimly
                                        lit lamp. He had been bad. Was that why this was happening?

                                        He stayed in that corner for what seemed like an eternity. Despite this feeling,
                                        he knew it was finally time for dinner when his father emerged from the study,
                                        and sat at the already-set table.

                                        Calvin reluctantly approached the table. He felt sick to his stomach. Before he
                                        could resist the wife had already placed him in his seat and tightly pushed his
                                        chair in. </p>
                                    <br /> <br />
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        "Smells good" the man said, fasting a white kerchief around his neck. The wife
                                        waits to him the sit before taking a seat herself. <br /> <br />

                                        In his peripherals, Calvin could see three distinct pools of red.

                                        "Father we thank you deeply for this bounty…" While his mother says grace,
                                        Calvin enters this silent trance. Even though it takes everything in his power
                                        not to scream, his fear gets the best of him and he lets out a weak whimper.
                                        Last time he interrupted mama during grace, there were painful consequences.<br/> <br/>

                                        "Mama, please— the food! It’s —" the wife opens here eyes and gives Calvin a
                                        stare, one filled with shock and anger.

                                        "What is it now?" <br /> <br />

                                        "The food was alive. And — and —" <br /> <br />

                                        "Yes, of course it was alive dear, all food was once living. That’s no reason to
                                        behave like so." <br /> <br />

                                        The father takes a spoon full of soup into his wide mouth, this fact not lost on
                                        Calvin. From where he’s sitting, he sees pieces of carrot flesh — some with
                                        eyes, some with other parts of the face, swimming in the bowl. He dared not look
                                        at the bowl in front of him.<br /> <br /><br /> <br />
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        "Now, be a big boy and finish your soup" the mother took a spoonful of corn,
                                        carrot and kale to her lips. The man nodded curtly, his darkened eyes glaring at
                                        his son in disdain. <br/> <br/>
                                        "But I can’t eat them, they were alive, right before y..you cut them to
                                        p..pieces". Calvin could not hold back his tears and they came flooding out like
                                        an opening reservoir. <br/> <br/>

                                        "With that imagination of yours son, you should become a story teller!" The wife
                                        said jokingly, not understanding what enticed this tantrum.<br/> <br/>

                                        He thought to leave the table crossed his mind numerous times. whenever he
                                        thought he had enough courage to do it, his eyes would meet his father’s and he
                                        would, once again, feel glued to the chair beneath him.<br/> <br/>

                                        Grace was finished, and the parents exchanged words and pleasantries, the sounds
                                        of whispers and laughter turning into a hubbub that helped Calvin to remove
                                        himself from this scene.<br/> <br/>

                                        He attempts to respectfully grab his father’s attention many times. But the old
                                        man often ignored his pleas of desperation. And so the night went on, His mom
                                        slowly raising little broccoli limbs to her lips, slurping the thick red broth
                                        softly. <br/> <br/>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>

                                        Calvin felt as if he might burst into tears again, except this time it all felt
                                        stuck in his throat. The wife gracefully sets down her spool and glances at the
                                        full plate in front of her son. She remembers that he hadn’t eaten much after
                                        coming home from school. She refused to have another meal wasted.<br/> <br/>

                                        "Sweetie, you’ve barely touched your plate," the wife said dryly. <br/> <br/>

                                        "Mama," he sniffs in the mucus that almost left his nostrils. "Mama please don’t
                                        make me," Calvin blinks, setting a stream of tears in motion down his round
                                        cheeks. <br/> <br/>

                                        "You have to eat, Calvin" she pleaded. "Don’t you want to grow up to be strong
                                        like the older kids?" <br/> <br/>

                                        "Mama I can’t!" he screamed, "please.. please… I’m begging you" he
                                        hyperventilated. The wife would not have any of it. Her mouth opened to speak
                                        again, but it’s the man’s voice that filled the room with wrath. <br/> <br/>

                                        "That’s enough! Now finish your plate or I will have you sit at this table all
                                        night". The wife felt sorry, but once the man spoke, there was no going back. <br/> <br/>

                                        Calvin sat still. The last time the man was angry, he would never forget. It was
                                        two months ago. They were having a cookout and while playing with the dog,
                                        Calvin knocked over the grill, the guests grasped in disapproval, embarrassing
                                        the wife beyond forgiveness. It had taken half a day for the burning sensation
                                        on cease throbbing when the man was finished with him. <br/> <br/>

                                        It didn’t take long for reality to settle despite the living nightmare. Calvin
                                        turned and looked at the plate before him for the first time. Parts of his brain
                                        tingled trying to process what his eyes saw. He remembered when Simon, his
                                        goldfish had died. The organ corpse floated up to the top of the fishbowl. He
                                        had never seen Simon at that angle before. When the wife explained what had
                                        happened, he felt numb. Now, he imagined Simon being cut up to pieces, being
                                        added to his plate, his face much like the chopped up, distorted faces he saw
                                        before him.
                                        <br/> <br/>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Without thinking, his hand reached for the soup spoon. Although he hadn’t looked
                                        up, he knew the adults’ eyes were on him. The room fell still and silent. His
                                        hand shook as he scooped up a pieces of reddened potato and broccoli. The spoon
                                        slid smoothly against his lips and upper teeth. He swallowed fast, his throat
                                        going numb after making contact with the thick broth. And so it resumed. The
                                        adults resumed murmuring about their complex, dull lives, their voices creating
                                        a vague echo around the room.

                                        In no time, the boy was full. But somehow, he felt emptier than ever.
